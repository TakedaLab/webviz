# Tab

Allows users to group multiple Webviz panels in a mini layout, each nested under a tab.

## Grouping Panels into a Tab Panel

Select or deselect any panel by pressing `Cmd` + click.

Users can choose one of 2 ways to group the selected panels:

- Combine selected panels under a single tab in a new Tab panel
- Create a separate tab for each selected panel in a new Tab panel

Hovering over any of the selected panels will allow you to make your choice.
